# Quadrotor-Simulator-and-Control
- This project aims at developing the PD controller to control the motion of a quadrotor in 1D (Z-axis direction - height) as well as 2D (YZ plane).
- One of the MATLAB's ODE solver called ode45 is used to simulate the behavior of the quadrotor.
- In 1D, the quadrotor is controlled for two scenarios - one is to hover at specific height and another is to raise at particular height command and then stabilize.
- In both scnearios, the objective was to develop PD controller in such a way that the rise time to be less than 1 second and maximum overshoot to be less than 5%.
- In 2D, the quadrotor is controlled to follow the line trajectory as well as sine wave trajectory in YZ plane.
